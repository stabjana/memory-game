# Memory Game

This app is a classical memory game, no weird twists, no unnecessary stuff. Just good old-fashioned card flipping action. Match the pairs, test your brain and avoid rage-quitting, there are different levels of difficulty. :brain:

## Technical stuff

Built with: React + JavaScript
Images: Fetched from the Pexels API (because stock photos make everything better)
Logic: Cards flip, reveal an image, and if they match, they stay. :fairy:
